	                    <p>PlanPremier-TPA®’s-annual credit can have a meaningful impact to the plan’s costs over time.</p>
	                    <p>How the credit works: The mutual funds in the plan generate recordkeeping payments to help pay for the plan’s recordkeeping and administrationfees. These payments, along with a portion of the distribution/service fees paid by the funds, are used to reduce American Fund ’s recordkeepingfees through the plan credit. The plan credit is generally based on the amount of assets in the plan and varies by share class. If the recordkeepingfees exceed the amount of the plan credit, the plan will be invoiced for the difference. If the plan credit exceeds the recordkeeping fees, the plan willreceive a net credit. The chart below illustrates the potential savings generated by the credit.</p>

	        <li> The annual recordkeeping fee covers services such as daily valuation recordkeeping, contribution tracking and full-service withholding andtax reporting. The recordkeeping fee in this report is based on the number of participants entered. </li>
	        <li>The plan credit amount is based on an approximate credit rate that is applied as follows: 0.40% for R-2, 0.25% for R-2E, 0.25% for R-3, 0.05%for R-4, 0.15% for R-5E, 0.05% for R-5 and 0.00% for R-6. The credit rate for non-American Funds may vary. Credits are applied quarterly on allplan assets except self-directed brokerage accounts and other investment options that are not reported on the service provider’srecordkeeping system. </li>
	        <li>  For PlanPremier, credit rates may vary depending on a plan's investment options. </li>
	        <li> Advisor compensation is included in the funds’ expense ratios (see investment cost). Average expense ratios are provided only as examples.The actual average expense ratio depends on the investments selected for the plan and participant allocations. Expense ratios reflectapplicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements, without which expenses would be higher.The average expense ratio for each share classis for all funded investments and is weighted, based on average daily net assets in the program as of 12/31/2018. Accordingly, more weight isgiven to funds with more assets. Actual expense ratios, as reported in each fund’s prospectus at the time of publication, range from 0.99% to4.30% for R-2; 0.50% to 2.35% for R-2E; 0.64% to 3.57% for R-3; 0.35% to 3.55% for R-4; 0.02% to 1.93% for R-5E; 0.02% to 2.29% for R-5;0.02% to 3.07% for R-6. Expense ratios for certain funds in some share classes are estimated. Please see fund prospectuses for details. </li>
	        <li> The third-party administrator (TPA) charges separately for administration services. The fee included in this estimate is fixed. The actual amountmay vary if the TPA charges in basis points.</li>
	        <li>  Total annual costs are estimated. Fees for services that are not required for all plans, such as trustee/custodial and fiduciary services, are notincluded. Trustee and 403(b) custodial services are provided by Capital Bank & Trust Company for an annual fee of $750. Fiduciary servicesare available through Wilshire Associates Incorporated for an annual fee of 0.02% of plan assets for 3(21) services or 0.05% of plan assets for 3(38) services.</li>
